OpenTK 0.3.3 -> 0.3.4
+ Corrected the crash error in Release mode (it was caused by trying to Marshal the System.Windows.Forms.Message struct to PeekMessage - adding my own Message struct corrected the issue).
+ Corrected the call to glShaderSource GLSL.Lesson01. Now the correct number is passed to the count parameter, while the null parameter was changed to IntPtr.Zero (Mono now no longers fails in this call).
+ Updated the GLSL.Lesson01 example to use GetShaderInfoLog on compilation failure.
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.7.5.1 -> 0.7.5.2 (see Bind changelog for more information)
+ Full Mono support under windows.

OpenTK 0.3.2 -> 0.3.3
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.7.5 -> 0.7.5.1 (see Bind changelog for more information)
+ Added the GLForm class which sets the base for cross-platform screen, context and keyboard handling.
+ Can now change between fullscreen and windowed modes.
+ Temporarily removed all examples except for GLSL.Lesson01, which has been updated to use the new GLForm class.

OpenTK 0.3.1 -> 0.3.2
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Glu: Eliminated the temporary IntPtr variable in the GetString and ErrorString functions.
+ Specifications.cs_types.txt: Changed types in order to be CLS compliant.
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.7.4 -> 0.7.5
+ Added the GLSL.Lesson01 example.

OpenTK 0.3.0 -> 0.3.1
+ Updated the binding generator to version 0.7.4, based on the work done for Tao.
+ Updated the Context load functions. Now Context loads all functions are extensions, and the derived classes override this behavior as needed.
+ Changed the uint array used in the DisplayLists example to an int array.
+ Added the changelog! :)
