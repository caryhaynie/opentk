Todo:
+ + + Add basic GLX bindings.
+ + Add cross-platform way for overriding the Application.Idle handler.
+ Add more examples.
+ + Change the hierarchy of the WindowsContext and WindowsVistaContext classes. The should have a common ancestor who manages the windows creation (it should be the same for both).
+ + Add more constructors to the WindowsContext classes. This probably needs updating of the WinAPI assembly.
+ + Add X11Context constructors.
+ + Add more GLForm constructors.
+ Find out what is needed for the MacOS platform (how to do function loading and window management without X11).
+ Add full bindings to Glu, Wgl, Glx and Agl.
+ Add the Math module.
+ Research and add the Input module.
+ Review and add the Timer module.
+ Review and add the OpenAL module.
+ Add projects for MonoDevelop.
+ See if using Nant for building is a good idea.
+ + Clean up the code.
+ + Add comments and documentation (faqs, pitfalls, best practices).
+ + + Add the CLS compliant attribute to the GL class.
+ Add more platform bindings.
