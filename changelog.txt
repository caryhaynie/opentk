OpenTK 0.3.6


OpenTK 0.3.5 -> 0.3.6
+ Updates to OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind (see that changelog for more info).
	+ Revamped GL class (it is self contained now).
	+ Revamped GLContext class (it is no longer bound to the GL class initialisation).
+ Directory structure updates.
	+ Now every project has its own documentation.
	+ The spec files for OpenGL now reside in the Source/OpenTK/OpenGL directory.
+ Framework updates:
	+ Cleaner implementation.
	+ New namespace.
	+ Supports basic mode sswitching under windows (the code is not robust enough, yet).
+ Added very basic GLX and X bindings, just enough to create a basic OpenGL window.


OpenTK 0.3.4 -> 0.3.5
+ Major update to OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind (cleaner code, new functions, comments and many new wrappers).
+ Updated the spec files for opengl 2.1.
	+ Added the new 64 bit types to the typemaps (gl.tm and csharp.tm)
+ The bugs in the specs are still there:
	+ SGIX_icc_texture is still commented out, while enums use it.
	+ LightProperty is still used by constants (the correct enum is LightParameter).
		+ I think I should contact someone at the Khronos group about these. For the time being I worked around them, by adding a special case for LightProperty in the translator, and adding the SGIX enum to the missing parameters.
		+ See also: http://www.haskell.org/HOpenGL/spec_bugs.html (lots of useful information on that site).
+ Laid the foundation for X (Linux, Unix, MacOS) support.
	+ Added bindings to some glx functions.
	+ Added the OpenTK.Platform.X class.
+ Minor updates to the wgl bindings (int -> IntPtr).
+ Tested the binding generator with the glx specs (the reader and the enum writer work ok, the trnaslator and the other writers will need updating).
+ Renamed the GLForm to Framework.
	+ The Framework now resides in its own project directory.
+ Revamped the GLContext class hierarchy. WindowsContext and WindowsVistaContext now both inherit from WindowsBaseContext. This allows for less code-duplication (and thus less bugs).


OpenTK 0.3.3 -> 0.3.4
+ Corrected the crash error in Release mode (it was caused by trying to Marshal the System.Windows.Forms.Message struct to PeekMessage - adding my own Message struct corrected the issue).
+ Corrected the call to glShaderSource GLSL.Lesson01. Now the correct number is passed to the count parameter, while the null parameter was changed to IntPtr.Zero (Mono now no longers fails in this call).
+ Updated the GLSL.Lesson01 example to use GetShaderInfoLog on compilation failure.
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.7.5.1 -> 0.7.5.2 (see Bind changelog for more information)
+ Full Mono support under windows.


OpenTK 0.3.2 -> 0.3.3
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.7.5 -> 0.7.5.1 (see Bind changelog for more information)
+ Added the GLForm class which sets the base for cross-platform screen, context and keyboard handling.
+ Can now change between fullscreen and windowed modes.
+ Temporarily removed all examples except for GLSL.Lesson01, which has been updated to use the new GLForm class.


OpenTK 0.3.1 -> 0.3.2
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Glu: Eliminated the temporary IntPtr variable in the GetString and ErrorString functions.
+ Specifications.cs_types.txt: Changed types in order to be CLS compliant.
+ OpenTK.OpenGL.Bind 0.7.4 -> 0.7.5
+ Added the GLSL.Lesson01 example.


OpenTK 0.3.0 -> 0.3.1
+ Updated the binding generator to version 0.7.4, based on the work done for Tao.
+ Updated the Context load functions. Now Context loads all functions are extensions, and the derived classes override this behavior as needed.
+ Changed the uint array used in the DisplayLists example to an int array.
+ Added the changelog! :)
